# EdgeAI-RiscV-VSDSquadron

**A comprehensive 10-day workshop repository covering RISC-V and Edge AI development**

---

## Overview

**EdgeAI-RiscV-VSDSquadron** is a repository documenting a 10-day extensive workshop on applying **RISC-V architecture** in **Edge AI** contexts.  

It contains instructional Jupyter notebooks, datasets, header files, and visual outputs used throughout the sessionsâ€”making it a complete reference for learners, researchers, and hobbyists exploring the intersection of **AI and RISC-V**.

This repository documents my learning journey through the RISC-V Edge AI with VSDSquadron PRO course, offered by VLSI System Design (VSD). The course focuses on implementing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models on resource-constrained embedded systems, targeting the VSDSquadron PRO board powered by the SiFive FE310-G002 RISC-V SoC. Due to the absence of physical hardware, this project was developed and simulated using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for both the camera-based image capture and the training of a quantized neural network for MNIST handwritten digit classification.

The project uses a training.py script to train and quantize an 8-bit neural network model for MNIST digit recognition, with inference simulated in a bare-metal environment compatible with the SiFive FE310-G002. This README outlines the course content, project setup, key learnings, and instructions for running the simulated application.
