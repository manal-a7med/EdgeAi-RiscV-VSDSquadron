## Getting Started

###  Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Python libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
  ```

*(Consider adding a `requirements.txt` for convenience.)*

---

### âš¡ Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manal-a7med/EdgeAi-RiscV-VSDSquadron.git
   cd EdgeAi-RiscV-VSDSquadron
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is not yet available, manually install the libraries above.)*

3. **Run notebooks**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open and execute the notebooks in order for a structured learning flow.

4. **(Optional: Hardware Setup)**  
   If interfacing with RISC-V hardware, use `zadig-2.9.exe` to configure USB drivers.
